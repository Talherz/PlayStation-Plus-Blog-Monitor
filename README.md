# 🌟 PS Plus Game Arrivals Tracker

An automated, serverless Node.js bot that natively parses the Official PlayStation Blog RSS feed to detect new "Monthly Essential" and "Game Catalog" announcements, extracts the specific games using regex strategies, and delivers formatted lists directly to a Discord server.

Built securely on **GitHub Actions**, this script utilizes GitHub Secrets for environment variables and relies on an internal JSON state tracker to ensure announcements are only posted once. 

## ✨ Features
* **Native RSS Parsing:** Uses `fast-xml-parser` to read the official PlayStation feed instantly.
* **Smart HTML Extraction:** Employs a multi-tiered regex algorithm (Pipe markers -> Bullet point checks -> Title fallback) to accurately scrape game names out of unstructured blog paragraphs.
* **Tier Sorting:** Automatically isolates and categorizes "Extra" vs "Premium" tier additions.
* **Rate Limit Protection:** Features an automated sleep-and-retry loop to handle Discord API 429 rate limit rejections gracefully.
* **Secure Architecture:** Uses GitHub Secrets to inject Webhook URLs at runtime, keeping all server credentials entirely hidden from the codebase.
